## Projects

### 1. Caesar Cipher Implementation
- **Description**: A Python program implementing the Caesar cipher encryption and decryption technique.
- **Features**:
  - Encrypts plaintext by shifting characters.
  - Decrypts ciphertext back to plaintext.
  - Allows customizable shift values.
- **Usage**:
  Run the script, input the text, choose an operation (encrypt or decrypt), and provide the shift value.

### 2. Simple Image Encryption Tool
- **Description**: An image encryption and decryption tool using pixel manipulation.
- **Features**:
  - Encrypts images by applying mathematical operations or swapping pixel values.
  - Decrypts images using the reverse operations.
  - Provides a simple user interface for selecting images and modes.
- **Usage**:
  Load an image, choose an operation (encrypt/decrypt), and save the result.

### 3. Password Complexity Cracker
- **Description**: A program to evaluate and crack password complexity by analyzing strength and guessing patterns.
- **Features**:
  - Assesses password strength based on length, character variety, and patterns.
  - Attempts to crack weak passwords using brute force or dictionary attacks.
- **Usage**:
  Input a password, analyze its complexity, and optionally simulate a cracking attempt.

### 4. Simple Keylogger
- **Description**: A lightweight keylogger for monitoring keyboard activity.
- **Features**:
  - Captures keystrokes and logs them to a file securely.
  - Operates in stealth mode for testing and educational purposes.
  - Includes safeguards to prevent misuse.
- **Usage**:
  Run the keylogger script, and it will log keystrokes to a specified file.

> **Note**: Use this tool responsibly and only in environments where you have explicit permission.

### 5. Network Packet Analyzer
- **Description**: A program for analyzing network traffic by capturing and inspecting packets.
- **Features**:
  - Captures live network packets.
  - Displays detailed packet information such as source, destination, protocol, and payload.
  - Filters packets based on user-defined criteria.
- **Usage**:
  Run the script with administrative privileges, start capturing packets, and apply filters as needed.
